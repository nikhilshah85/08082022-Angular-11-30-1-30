		Developer is suppose to create the contents accordingly
			We had server side tech - ASP.Net, Java, JSP, PHP, Python etc......	
				This are all server side tech

		We need client centeric APPS - web contents

		Google, Facebook, MS came ahead and create client centric framework  (SPA - single paged application)



		-----------------------------------------------

		To meet all of the above changes W3C and ECMA 
			W3C - World wide web consorium 
			ECMA - European Computer Manufacturing Association 

			HTML ---> HTML5
			CSS  ---> CSS3
			JS   ---> ES6  

	JS was not OOPS based - EcmaScript is OOPS based - which gets converted to JS as per browser standards


		But, ES was very difficult to write (very difficult)
			Thus MS made it easy by applying a wrapper on it - Typescript    - Microsoft
								Google used Typescript   - Angular
								Facebook used Typescript - React
								Twitter used Typescript  - Bootstrap
								IBM / HP / Sun           - Knockout / backbone etc...

					AngularJS vs Angular






	In early days - it use be AngularJS - this is light weight JS library based on MVC pattern 
			suitable for client side filter, sort, data manipulation, SPA apps 
			good for small app only
	
			Heavy apps fails here
			To be used with server side page

		last version was 1.7


	After that Anguar 2.0 was released
		based on Typescript, OOPS and Component based development against MVC
		Stand alone development
